# Welcome to My Convex Optimization
***

## Task
The problem involves solving mathematical optimization and root-finding problems using various algorithms, including linear programming and root-finding methods. The challenge lies in efficiently implementing these algorithms.

## Description
The code provides solutions to mathematical optimization problems using the linprog function from scipy.optimize, and it finds roots of functions using bisection and Newton-Raphson methods.

## Installation
There is no installation required as the code is executed in a Jupyter notebook, and the necessary Python libraries (numpy, scipy, and matplotlib) are imported directly.

## Usage
The code uses optimization and root-finding algorithms to solve mathematical problems. It defines functions for gradient descent, linear problem solving, printing functions, and various root-finding methods.
